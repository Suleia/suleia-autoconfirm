# Suleia agent handoff

Updated: 2026-07-25

## Purpose

This document lets Codex and the ChatGPT confirmation agent work from the same
repository context without sharing hidden memory, browser sessions or secrets.

GitHub is the durable coordination layer:

- repository files hold stable rules and implementation;
- the Agent Hub issue holds current work, findings and next actions;
- commits and pull requests hold proposed or implemented changes;
- Render and Supabase remain runtime systems, not agent-to-agent chat channels.

## Repository

- Name: `Suleia/suleia-autoconfirm`
- Default branch: `main`
- Production service: Suleia AutoConfirm on Render
- Runtime state: Supabase plus the service operational cache

Never place credentials or customer personal data in this document, issues,
commits or pull requests.

## Handoff format

```text
FROM: Codex | ChatGPT confirmation agent
STATUS: analysis | proposed | implemented | verified | blocked
SCOPE: <subsystem, files and anonymized order references>
SUMMARY: <what was learned or changed>
EVIDENCE: <tests, logs or links without secrets or personal data>
RISKS: <known risks or "none">
NEXT: <one concrete next action>
```

## Ownership rules

- An agent may analyze any repository code it can read.
- Only one agent should implement a given change at a time.
- Before editing, claim the work in the Agent Hub issue with `STATUS: proposed`.
- After publishing, post the commit or pull request and focused test result.
- The other agent reviews the evidence before starting overlapping work.
- User instructions always override an agent proposal.

## Production boundaries

- Reading production health and logs is allowed when authorized credentials are
  available.
- Real confirmation, cancellation, messaging and incident resolution are
  customer-impacting actions.
- Do not execute a customer-impacting action merely because another agent
  proposed it. Require the user's explicit authorization or an already-approved
  production automation rule.
- Do not alter Chatby templates or flows while investigating an unrelated
  problem.

## Instructions for the ChatGPT project

Add the GitHub app to the ChatGPT project and select
`Suleia/suleia-autoconfirm`. Start confirmation-agent tasks with:

```text
Use the connected GitHub repository Suleia/suleia-autoconfirm.
Read AGENTS.md, docs/AGENT_HANDOFF.md and the open Agent Hub issue first.
Follow their safety and handoff protocol. Do not expose secrets or customer
personal data. Do not modify production unless I explicitly authorize it.
```

When the ChatGPT agent finishes a task, it should write a handoff comment in
the Agent Hub issue. If its GitHub connection is read-only, it should return
the handoff block to the user for posting.

## Instructions for Codex

At the beginning of a coordinated task, read the latest Agent Hub comments.
At the end, post the implementation or verification result there. Keep detailed
customer data only in approved production systems and summarize evidence in
GitHub using anonymized references.
